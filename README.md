# Welcome to my tech portfolio!

ðŸ‘‰ Check it out here: https://tiffwang.co.nz/

My portfolio features the projects I've been working on and showcases the AWS projects Iâ€™ve completed with the AWS community, NextWork. The site also has an "About Me" section where you can learn more about me and even catch a glimpse of my adorable cat ðŸ˜¼ .

I've put a lot of effort into building this from scratch using Next.js. Itâ€™s fully responsive and includes some animation spice with CSS and Framer Motion.

âœ¨ Stay tuned for future project updates!
