      <h2>Presentation</h2>

      <p>
        Developing emotional intelligence can support people to interact with
        others in a more positive and harmonious manner which will lead to
        improved overall well-being and stronger relationship. People with high
        EQ are tend to build better relationship with others because they know
        how to communicate effectively and emphasise others to gain trust.
        <br />
        <br />
        High EQ also helps people to resolve conflicts more constructively as
        they respond to different opinion professionally and foster respectful
        discussions. EQ also plays a vital role in leadership and teamwork by
        promoting collaboration, motivation and inspiration.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most importantly, high EQ helps to look after our mental well-being as
        it enables us to bounce back from stressful emotions, so that we are
        emotionally stronger and resilient. It can be seen that developing a
        high EQ is beneficial to both personal growth and professional success.
