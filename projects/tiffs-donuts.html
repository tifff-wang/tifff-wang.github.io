            <h2>Recent update</h2>
            <p>
                I have recently refined the website UI and implement AWS Cognito
                as authentication method instead of the previous AuthO. The web
                is hosted on AWS EC2.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>

            <p>
                Tiff's Donuts is my final group project from Dev Academy. During
                this project, I acted as the Product Owner with five other team
                members where we developed a web application where users could
                design and customise 3D donuts. The website includes rendering
                3D models, interactions and scrolling effects using threeJS and
                React. During this intensive 7-day project, I had the
                opportunity to take the lead in introducing and implementing
                React Three Fiber, a technology not covered in our bootcamp.
                This experience was truly valuable as it showcased our team's
                dedication to collaborative problem-solving and our ability to
                adapt and learn on the fly.
