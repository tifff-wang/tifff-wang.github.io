      <h2>Project Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Tiff's Donuts is my final group project from Dev Academy. During this
        project, I acted as the Product Owner with five other team members where
        we developed a web application where users could design and customise 3D
        donuts. The website includes rendering 3D models, interactions and
        scrolling effects using threeJS and React. During this intensive 7-day
        project, I had the opportunity to take the lead in introducing and
        implementing React Three Fiber, a technology not covered in our
        bootcamp. This experience was truly valuable as it showcased our team's
        dedication to collaborative problem-solving and our ability to adapt and
        learn on the fly.
      </p>

      <h2>Tech Stacks</h2>
      <p>
        <i
          >React Three Fiber(Drei) | React (Vite) | TailwindCSS | Auth0
          <br />
          React Router | SuperAgent | Vitest | PlayWright</i
        >
      </p>

      <h2>Future possiblities</h2>
      <p>
        I will continue to explore different visual effects that React Three
        Fiber can create by adding more sections to the homepage. These sections
        will feature various scrolling effects, including animations of the
        donut from different positions and camera angles.
