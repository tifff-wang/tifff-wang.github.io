# How I host a website on Amazon S3?

In this project, I:

-   üí° Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.
-   üí° Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.
-   üí° Tackled public access settings and bucket visioning.

## Step 1: Create a S3 bucket

Make sure **ACLs, public access and bucket versioning** are enabled.

    <h3>Key notes ‚úèÔ∏è:</h3>
    <h4>What's ACL?</h4>
    <p>
        Access control list - A set of rules that decides who can get access to
        a resource.
    </p>

    <h4>Why need a unique bucket name?</h4>
    <p>
        An S3 bucket name is globally unique, and all AWS accounts share the
        namespace. After you create a bucket, no other AWS accounts in the
        entire world can use your bucket's name unless you delete the bucket.
    </p>

## Step 2: Upload website files into the bucket

/>

## Step 3: Time to host the website!

Scroll allllllllll the way down to the **Static website hosting** panel to enalble hosting.

## Step 4: Add bucket versioning

    alt="screenshot of bucket versioning"

-   By default, bucket versioning is disabled.When bucket versioning is disabled, you **can not reverse** any future modification. For instance, you will **lose** the old file if you upload a new version. Similarly, the file you **delete will gone forever forever with no option for recovery**.
-   Therefore, if you want to preserve all the old versions, make sure to enabling versioning
-   It's crucial to note that once enabled, **bucket versioning cannot be deactivated**.

## Step 5: Using a bucket policy to secure the bucket

If you want to protect your HTML file that no one can delete them. You can apply a bucket policy!

-   Choose the **Permissions** tab in the bucket page.
-   Choose **Edit** to edit the policy.

Voila! Now no one can delete your bucket without permission!
