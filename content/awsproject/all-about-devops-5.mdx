# Automate software releases with AWS CodePipeline

## In this project, I learned how to:

-   💡 Set up the pipeline.
-   💡 Execute the pipeline.
-   💡 Release a change.
-   💡 Trigger a rollback.

### ✅ Steps completed from previous project sections:

Step 1: Setting up a web app and IDE in the Cloud

Step 2: Create a Repository in AWS CodeCommit

Step 3: Secure the project's dependencies with AWS CodeArtifact

Step 4: Package an App with AWS CodeBuild

Step 5: Deploy the App with AWS CodeDeploy

## ⏭️ Step 6: Automate the entire pipeline (from CodeCommit to CodeDeploy) with AWS CodePipeline.

#### 1. Set up a new pipeline in CodePipeline and configured the source, build and deploy stages in your pipeline.

#### 2. Execute a pipeline

I learned what it means when the pipeline is running, watching your code being automatically tested, built, and deployed step by step.

#### 3. Release a change

I added the landing page html file to my local file and commit and pushed the changes to the CodeCommit repository. The pipeline executes automatically where my latest version of your code is tested, built, and deployed without manual intervention.

The web page is live 🎉

#### 4. Trigger a rollback

    <h3>Key notes ✏️:</h3>
    <h4>What's rollback?</h4>
    <span>
        A rollback lets you go back to a previous version of your application
        that worked well—this can be a lifesaver if new changes cause problems!
        In this instance, you only rolled back the deployment stage. This means
        your source code and build won't be touched, but the version of the
        application on the server is back to how it was before your latest
        update.
    </span>

Simply select the "Release change" button again to bring back the latest version.

Woohoo!! Now I have a fully managed CI/CD pipeline working!

#### Big thanks to [@NextWork](https://www.nextwork.org/) for setting up this engaging challenge!
