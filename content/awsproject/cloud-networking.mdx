# Build a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

When I'm learning the AWS services, I always found the VPC related concepts are some of the tricky part to get my heads around. In this project, I learned the core essentials of building an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which has helped me to get a better understanding of the purposes and raltionship of the VPC set up.

In this project, I created:

-   💡 **An Amazon VPC** with configured IPv4 CIDR block
-   💡 **A public subnet** with auto-assigned public IP addresses
-   💡 **An internet gateway** associate to the VPC
-   💡 **A route table** to send Internet-bound traffic to your internet gateway
-   💡 **A security group** to control inbound and outbound traffic at a resource level, specifying allowed IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
-   💡 **A network ACL** (Access Control List) as an additional layer of security, managing both incoming and outgoing traffic at the subnet level.
-   💡 **A private subnet** with a different CIDR block to avoid an overlap with your public subnet.
-   💡 **A private route** table that only allow local target.
-   💡 **A private network** ACL that deny both inbound and outbound traffic.

After working through the process, I conclude the relationships of the services as below:

    <ul>
        <li>**AWS Cloud Region** - Country</li>
        <li>**VPC** - City</li>
        <li>**Subnet** - Neibourhood in the city </li>
        <li>**Internet gateway** - GPS in the city </li>
        <li>
            **Network ACLs** - Security guard at your neibourhood entrance and
            exit{' '}
        </li>
        <li>**Resources** - Buildings in your neibourhood</li>
        <li>
            **Surcurity group** - Security guard at your building entrance and
            exit
        </li>
        <li>**IP address** - Street addresses for the resources </li>
        <li>
            **Protocols (ex. HTTP, FTP)** - Different vehicles that deliver data
            in different ways{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
            **Port numbers** - Delivery dock at the building for a specific
            vehicle (protocol)
        </li>
    </ul>
