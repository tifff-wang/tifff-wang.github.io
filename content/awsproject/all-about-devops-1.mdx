# Set Up a Web App in the Cloud and Git Repository With AWS CodeCommit

In this project, I learned how to:

-   üí° Launched a new Cloud9 IDE.
-   üí° Installed Apache Maven and Java.
-   üí° Used Maven to set up a basic web app structure.
-   üí° Set up a CodeCommit repository
-   üí° Initialize a local repository and set its remote origin to my CodeCommit repo.
-   üí° Add, commit and push in Cloud9 IDE.

## Step 1: Setting up a web app and IDE in the Cloud

-   Create a new environment in Cloud9 console to launch a new Cloud9 IDE

    <h3>Key notes ‚úèÔ∏è:</h3>
    <h4>What is Apache Maven?</h4>
    <p>
       Apache Maven is a powerful tool that automates the building of software.

Building is an important multi-step process that transforms code written by developers into a final product that is ready for computers to run. The key steps typically include:

<strong>Compiling, Linking, Packaging, Testing</strong>.

Each of these steps is absolutely crucial for producing a functioning software application. Tools like Apache Maven automate these processes for you!

## Step 2: Create a Repository in AWS CodeCommit

    <h4>What is CodeCommit?</h4>
    <p>
        AWS CodeCommit is a service that host Git repositories securely in the
        cloud.

-   Navigate to Codecommit console to set up a git repository

    alt="create CodeCommit repository panel"
/>

-   Set up the git identity in cloud9
    It helps the Git to know who is making changes to a repository.

    alt="git identity command in termial"
/>

-   Initialize a local repository

<img
    src="/images/aws-images/devOps/initial-git.png"
    alt="command to inital git repo in terminal"
/>

-   Set its remote origin to CodeCommit git repo

    -   Clone the HTTPS URL from the CodeCommit repo

<img
    src="/images/aws-images/devOps/codecommit-repo.png"
    alt="codeCommit repo panel"
/>

    -   Connect to the remote repository by appling the URL above in the command.

<img
    src="/images/aws-images/devOps/git-remote-add.png"
    alt="command of remote add origin in terminal"
/>

-   Add, Commit and Push

<img
    src="/images/aws-images/devOps/initial-commit.png"
    alt="commands for initial commit"
/>

-   The source code appears in the remote CodeCommit repo.

<img
    src="/images/aws-images/devOps/remote-repo.png"
    alt="codeCommit repo panel with source code"
/>

-   Here's how to make a second commit

    alt="commands for second commit"

Now the CodeCommit repository is ready to store and version control the code.
