# How I used Amazon QuickSight to visualise Netflix's catalogue trends?

In this project, I learned how to:

-   üí° Connect datasets to Amazon QuickSight for analysis.
-   üí° Create visualisations like donut charts, bar graphs, and tables.
-   üí° Using QuickSight's functionalities to visual answers to more complex data questions.

## Step 1: Create a S3 bucket and upload files

After creating the bucket I uploaded 2 files:

1. a csv file
2. a manifest.json file

    <h3>Key notes ‚úèÔ∏è:</h3>
    <h4>About the manifest.json file</h4>
    <p>
        In the manifest.json file as shown below, I input the netflix csv file's
        URL to the URIs in order to allow the QuickSight to link to this SVC
        file later on.file is like a map that tells Amazon QuickSight where your
        data files are and how they're organised. It also describes what each
        piece of data looks like, so QuickSight knows how to understand the data
        and show it in charts or graphs

## Step 2: Sign up to the QuickSight

Just navigate to the Amazon QuickSight and follow the sign up steps.
Make sure S3 is selected as a resource that QuickSight has access to, and select your S3 bucket.

## Step 3: Connect QuickSight to the S3 bucket

In the QuickSight menu, navigate to Datasets and create a new dataset using S3 data.
Enter the S3 URL to your "manifest.json" file

## Step 4: Time to Create Visualisation

QuickSight can sort, filter, and customise data with a varitey of visualisation typs like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, etc, through manipulating the left-hand side panel.

Here's the one big dashboard that I created that visualised the Netflix's catalogue
trends in different ways.
