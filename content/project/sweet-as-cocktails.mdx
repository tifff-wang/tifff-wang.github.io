## Recent update

    **Codebase Refactoring**: When reviewing of the React codebase that I initially wrote while studying, I noticed it was quite cluttered. I've refactored it by separating the code into components to improve readability and maintainability.

## Tech stacks

React, Superagent, SASS, HTML, Node.js, Express.js, SQLite3, Knex

## Project Overview

    Sweet as Cocktail is the first full-stack web application that I developed
    during my study in Dev Academy. It is designed for restaurants to manage
     their cocktail menu. The application allows users to create, read, update,
     and delete (CRUD) cocktail menu items. The project uses React for the frontend
     and Node.js for the backend, following a structured and layered architecture.
     The frontend communicates with the backend through an API layer.
