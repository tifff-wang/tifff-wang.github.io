# Creative Bunny E-Commerce Shop

## Project Overview

    Tiff's Donuts is my final group project from Dev Academy. During this
    project, I acted as the Product Owner with five other team members where we
    developed a web application where users could design and customise 3D
    donuts. The website includes rendering 3D models, interactions and scrolling
    effects using threeJS and React. During this intensive 7-day project, I had
    the opportunity to take the lead in introducing and implementing React Three
    Fiber, a technology not covered in our bootcamp. This experience was truly
    valuable as it showcased our team's dedication to collaborative
    problem-solving and our ability to adapt and learn on the fly.
