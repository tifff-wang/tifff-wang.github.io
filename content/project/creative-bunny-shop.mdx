# Creative Bunny E-Commerce Shop

## Tech stacks

React, Redux Toolkit, Passkeys, Firebase, TypeScript, SaSS, Stripe

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Creative Bunny wooden toy shop!

This fully responsive website is a full-stack project built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Firebase.
It is based on a real toy business currently selling on Trademe. All toy details
and images are copyrighted by Creative Bunny Ltd. Working on this project has strengthened
my skills in the React and Redux frameworks, and has provided valuable practice with
essential e-commerce features such as setting up add-to-cart, checkout, and Stripe
payment functionalities.

## Recent update: Passkeys Authentication

The website now supports Passkey authentication as a secure and convenient passwordless sign-in option! Registered users can create a Passkey, allowing them to access their accounts seamlessly without needing to remember or enter a traditional password on future visits.

#### How It Works:

1. Registration: Users can sign up as usual using an email and password.
2. Passkey Setup: After registration, users are given the option to create a Passkey.
3. Passwordless Sign-In: On subsequent logins, users with a registered Passkey can sign in effortlessly with this option, enhancing both security and user convenience.

## A Testing Ground for New Ideas

<div>

This project is also a playground for trying new
things. I've recently added **Passkeys** to provide
users with a passwordless sign-in option. After having a taste of building a chatbot with Amazon Lex
during one of my AWS projects (see <a href="https://tiffwang.co.nz/awsproject/build-chatbot-with-amazon-lex" target="\_blank">
here</a>), going ahead, Iâ€™m interested in developing an **AI chatbot** for my e-commerce website by utilising Amazon Lex and training foundation models with Amazon Bedrock to enhance product recommendations and improve order checking using my own product data.

I aim not only to enhance the site but also to take the chance to experiment with some cool techs out there.

</div>

In the next phase of development, I plan to:

-   **Complete the footer links**: Add relevant pages to the links in the footer.
-   **Migrate to AWS**: As this e-commerce project evolves, such as integrating more features
    like order management and admin functionalities, transitioning to a more robust and scalable architecture
    becomes essential. Currently, the project uses Firebase for database interactions and Netlify
    functions for Stripe API calls directly from the front-end. Considering my future plan including
    implementing an AWS Lex chatbot and integrating additional order and admin-related APIs, I plan to migrate the
    project to AWS. This will not only provide the necessary infrastructure to improve the scalability and security
    of the application but also offer me a valuable opportunity to deepen my expertise with various AWS services.
