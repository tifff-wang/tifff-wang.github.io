# Creative Bunny E-Commerce Shop

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Creative Bunny wooden toy shop!

This fully responsive website is a full-stack project built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Firebase.
It is based on a real toy business currently selling on Trademe. All toy details
and images are copyrighted by Creative Bunny Ltd. Working on this project has strengthened
my skills in the React and Redux frameworks, and has provided valuable practice with
essential e-commerce features such as setting up add-to-cart, checkout, and Stripe
payment functionalities.

## Future Enhancements

In the next phase of development, I plan to add the following features to further improve the functionality of the website:

-   **Order History and Status**: Users will be able to check their order history and the status of current orders. This feature will help customers track their purchases and view updates in real time.

-   **Admin Access for Order Management**: A dedicated admin interface will be implemented to allow site administrators to view incoming orders from customers and update order statuses as needed.
