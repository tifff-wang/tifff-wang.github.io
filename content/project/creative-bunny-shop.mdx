# Creative Bunny E-Commerce Shop

## Tech stacks

React, Redux Toolkit, Firebase, TypeScript, SASS, Stripe

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Creative Bunny wooden toy shop!

This fully responsive website is a full-stack project built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Firebase.
It is based on a real toy business currently selling on Trademe. All toy details
and images are copyrighted by Creative Bunny Ltd. Working on this project has strengthened
my skills in the React and Redux frameworks, and has provided valuable practice with
essential e-commerce features such as setting up add-to-cart, checkout, and Stripe
payment functionalities.

## What's next?

In the next phase of development, I plan to:

-   **Complete the footer links**: Add relevant pages to the links in the footer.
-   **Implement PassKey**: Users will have the option to create a Passkey for passwordless sign-in.
-   **Migrate serverless backend to Firebase Functions**: The project currently interacts with the Firebase database using built-in Firebase methods directly from front-end and calls the Stripe API through Netlify functions. I plan to migrate all these functionalities into Firebase Backend Functions for better scalability and security.
-   **Order History and Status**: Users will be able to check their order history and the status of current orders. This feature will help customers track their purchases and view updates in real time.
-   **Admin Access for Order Management**: A dedicated admin interface will be implemented to allow site administrators to view incoming orders from customers and update order statuses as needed.
