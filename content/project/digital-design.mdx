# My Digital Design Works

I came across to learn HTML and CSS that sparks my passion for coding from a Digital Design Course from Yoobee College. During the design course, I participated in a variety of in-course as well as other volunteer design projects that includes UI/UX design, product design, web interface design and Webflow building.

I've learned to use Adobe XD, Illustrator, InDesign, Figma, and Webflow to produce design assets and prototypes.

What I like most about these projects are the design thinking process that guide me to produce designs that focus on users' needs. This design study experience has also helped to develop my strength of spotting UI/UX problems during development process.
