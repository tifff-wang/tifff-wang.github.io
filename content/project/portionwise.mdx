# PortionWise Backend

## Tech stacks
.NET Core, C#, Entity Framework, SQLite

## Project Overview

This project is for the backend of PortionWise, an app that manages cooking receipe ingredient portions. It contains CRUD API endpoints for both recipes and ingredients.

The project demonstrates a clean architecture implementation for a C# .NET backend with embedded Sqlite. The main components of this architecture are Controllers, Services, Repositories, Data Access Objects (DAOs), API, and different data models such as DTO, BO, Entity, and DL.

Through this project, I learned how to ensure the separation of concerns and enhance the maintainability of the codebase, as well as how to implement auto-mapping to efficiently transfer data between models and layers.

## What's next?

-   Integrate with a nutrition API to fetch and display nutritional information for each recipe based on ingredient portions.
-   Move on to build the front-end to make it a full-stack project.
