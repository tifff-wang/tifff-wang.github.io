# DescripMini

## Project Overview

DescripMini is a project I developed during my time at Dev Academy.
As a mother of a 3-year-old, I often sell second-hand baby items and found that writing product descriptions was time-consuming.
This experience inspired DescripMini. It is a basic web form
that integrates with the OpenAI API to automatically generate a short description
for users based on their input when they want to create second-hand selling listings.

## What's next?

I've recently reviewed this project and am planning to explore the feasibility of incorporating image recognition technology. I'm looking for the possiblity of allowing users to generate brief descriptions based directly on the images they upload, further simplifying the process of creating listings for second-hand items.
