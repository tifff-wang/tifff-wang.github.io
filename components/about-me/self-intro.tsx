                        My journey into the world of tech has been quite unique,
                        transitioning from a background in early childhood
                        education and studies in accounting and digital design.

                    <p>
                        This diverse experience has enriched my approach to
                        software development, especially in communication,
                        creativity, problem solving, and collaboration with
                        cross-functional teams. I am eager to continue learning
                        and growing in this ever-evolving field, and
                        collaborating with people to create engaging web
                        applications that positively impact people's lives âœ¨.
