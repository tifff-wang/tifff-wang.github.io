                        Hello ðŸ‘‹! I'm Tiff, a junior full-stack developer with a
                        passion for building engaging web applications.
                    </p>

                        {' '}
                        My journey into the world of tech has been quite unique,
                        transitioning from a background in early childhood
                        education and studies in accounting and digital design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This diverse experience has enriched my approach to
                        software development, especially in communication,
                        creativity, problem solving, and understanding user's
                        needs.
                    </p>
