                        Hello ðŸ‘‹! I'm a junior full-stack web developer with a
                        passion for building engaging web applications. My
                        journey into the world of tech has been quite unique,
                        transitioning from a background in early childhood
                        education and studies in accounting and digital design.
                        This diverse experience has enriched my approach to
                        software development, especially in understanding user
                        needs and enhancing user experience.
                        <br />
                        <br />I am proficient in a range of technologies
                        including{' '}
                        <strong>
                            TypeScript, React, Node.js, .NET, RESTful APIs, and

                        </strong>
