          When building a website, understanding different display properties is
          crucial for creating clean and well-structured layouts. "Inline,"
          "Block," and "Inline-block" are three commonly used display values,
          but I sometimes found them confusing when attempting to apply them in
          my web development. In this blog, I'll take an in-depth look at these
          display types with examples of code and screenshots. If you've ever
          wondered about these concepts like me, you've come to the right place!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>display: block</h2>
        <p>
          Before looking into the "Inline" and "Inline-block", let's have a look
          what is "Block". I first created 4 divs with different colors without
          setting the width, and you can see that it lines vertically with each
          div takes the whole width of the viewport.

          <img src="../images/images-inline-block/Set up 4 divs.png" />

          <br />
          This shows that the divs are <b>display: block</b>. Even I change the
          width to shorten each div, they will not move up to stay side by side,
          but still lines vertically.

          <img src="../images/images-inline-block/Change box width.png" />

          <br />
          Therefore, when an element is set to <b>display: block;</b>, it will
          create a rectangular box that spans the entire width of its parent
          container by default. This means that block-level elements start on a
          new line and occupy the full width available.
          <br>
          <br>
          Here are some elements that display <b>block</b> by defalt: 
          <ul>
            <li>div</li>
            <li>section</li>
            <li>p</li>
            <li>h1</li>
            <li>li</li>
            <li>br</li>
            <li>hr</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>display: inline</h2>
        <p>
          Now let's see what will happen if we add a <b>display:inline</b>.

          <img src="../images/images-inline-block/Display inline.png" />

          <br />
          You can see that under an <b>inline display</b>, the line breaks
          disappear, as well as the width of each div. This means that when
          applying <b>display:inline</b>, multiple inline elements will appear
          next to each other horizontally, as long as there's enough space, any
          height and width properties will no longer have effect, where the size
          of the div depends on its content inside.
          <br />
          Let's demenstrate it by increasing the font of the content or adding
          more texts.

          <img src="../images/images-inline-block/Inline bigger fonts.png" />
          <img src="../images/images-inline-block/Inline content change.png" />

          <br>
          <br>
          Here are some elements that display <b>inline</b> by defalt:
          <ul>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>span</li>
            <li>img</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>display: inline-block</h2>
        <p>
          We first change the edited content back. Now let's see what will
          happen if we change the display to <b>display:inline-block</b>.

          <img src="../images/images-inline-block/Display inline-block.png" />

          <br />
          We can see that the divs appear next to each other horizontally while
          maintaining the width setting.
          <br />
          <br />
          What if we add heights to the divs?

          <img src="../images/images-inline-block/Change box height.png" />

          <br />
          Or setting different width and height for each div?

          <img src="../images/images-inline-block/Set individual boxes.png" />

          <br />
          It can be seen that unlike inline elements, inline-block elements have
          combines the characteristics of both inline and block elements. They
          appear next to each other horizontally, just like inline elements, but
          at the same time maintain its specific width and height values like
          block elements.

          <br />
          <br />
          Based on its charastestic, inline-block is expecially useful when you
          want to control the layout of elements while maintaining their
          inline-like formatting.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <ul class="conclusion-list">
          <li><b>block</b>: The block element always starts on a new line and takes the full width of the viewport width or its parent's width. You can set width and height value to block elements. </li>
          <li><b>inline</b>: Inline elements appears next to each other and only takes the width depends on its content inside. You can not set the width or height value for inline elements.</li>
          <li><b>inline-block</b>: Inline-block element also appears next each other. But unlike inline, you are able to set width and height values for inline-block element.</li>
