      <h2>
        What is Emotional Intelligence?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (or known as emotional quotient or EQ) refers to the ability to recognise and manage our own emotions, as well as recognise and respond well to the emotions of others. A set of skills are essential in developing a person’s EQ:
        

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Self-awareness:</b> The ability to understand one's own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, values, and identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Self-regulation:</b> The ability to manage and control one's emotions and reactions when dealing with different situations. It involves being able to be adaptive and resilient during challenging or stressful situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Social awareness:</b> The skill of understanding other people’s emotions and needs. It involves empathy, active listening, and being attentive to non-verbal cues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Relationship management:</b> The ability to build and maintain healthy relationships through open communication, collaboration, and conflict management.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>
        How is EQ different to IQ?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Here I want to use a table to show the main differences between Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ):
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th><b>EQ</b></th>
          <th><b>IQ</b></th>
          
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Focus</b></td>
          <td>Emotions, interpersonal skills, self-awareness.</td>
          <td>Cognitive skills, logical reasoning.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><b>Skills</b></td>
          <td>Self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, relationship management.</td>
          <td>Mathematical reasoning, logical thinking, memory skill, learning capacity.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><b>How to improve</b></td>
          <td>Can be improved over time through self-reflection, practice, and learning from experiences and personal growth.</td>
          <td>More like a genetic feature. Stable and hard to improve through external factors. </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><b>Benefit</b></td>
          <td>Helps people to manage emotions, build strong relationships, and establish effective communication.</td>
          <td>Contribute to people's academic performance and problem-solving abilities.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><b>Measurement</b></td>
          <td>Measured using various EQ assessments and questionnaires.</td>
          <td>Measured using IQ tests.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>
        Why is EQ important?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Developing emotional intelligence can support people to interact with others in a more positive and harmonious manner which will lead to improved overall well-being and stronger relationship.
        People with high EQ are tend to build better relationship with others because they know how to communicate effectively and emphasise others to gain trust. 
        <br>
        <br>
        High EQ also helps people to resolve conflicts more constructively as they respond to different opinion professionally and foster respectful discussions. EQ also plays a vital role in leadership and teamwork by promoting collaboration, motivation and inspiration. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Most importantly, high EQ helps to look after our mental well-being as it enables us to bounce back from stressful emotions, so that we are emotionally stronger and resilient. It can be seen that developing a high EQ is beneficial to both personal growth and professional success.
