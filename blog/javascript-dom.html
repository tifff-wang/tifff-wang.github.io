      <p>Since I started my course at Dev Academy, I've been busy with my computer, and my non-tech savvy mum has shown a lot of interest in what I'm learning. So, I've decided to explain some JavaScript concepts to her to see if I can ransform some complex jargon into friendly spells :)</p>

      <h2>
        What’s JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS?

      </h2>

      <p>
        Imaging a <b>human body</b>, HTML helps to form the structure of your body, such as your bones, organs, skin, face, hair, etc. While CSS helps to add colours, shapes and styles your body parts so that you have skin tones, unique face features, and organs that positions perfectly to fit in your body. However, with only HTML and CSS, your body is not alive yet. How can we make the heart start to beat and cooperate with other organs to bring your body alive? How can you start to see things, start to talk and interact with others? Here’s the JavaScript come into play. JavaScript adds functionality to the different parts of your body, allowing them to work together, interact with the external environment, and bring your body to life.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What's <code class="code-text">control flow</code> and <code class="code-text">loops</code> in JavaScript?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Let’s imaging how you cook the noodle. You follow a particular order: boiling water, adding noodles, sprinkling salt, and finally, draining the cooked noodles. The order is carefully followed as you wouldn’t put the noodle when the water is not boiled right? This careful order is called control flow. When we write code, control flow helps the computer to execute the code in the correct order make our program work (noodle cooked).
        <br>
        <br>
        When you cook noodle, you can notice that there are several conditions, such as if the water is boiled? If the noodle is sticked to the bottom of the pot? If the noodle is tender? With each condition, we need to make different decisions and followed by corresponding actions. 
      </p>
        <pre class="code-example">
          <code>
            function cookNoodle() {
            if (waterIsCold) {
              check the heat
            } else if (waterIsBoiled) {
              add the noodle
            } else {
              wait for longer
            }
          }   
        </code>
        </pre>
      
      <p>
        The <code class="code-text">if</code>, <code class="code-text">else if</code>, and <code class="code-text">else</code> in this code is called conditional statement in the control flow that allows us to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For <code class="code-text">loop</code>, you can imaging that we have some guests come to our home and you plan to make some pancakes for the afternoon tea. You aim to make 10. As you follow the same step to make each pancake, the loop can perfectly describe this process. 
      </p>
        <pre class="code-example">
          <code>
            for (let piece = 1; piece <= 10; piece++) {             
              Steps of frying a pancake 
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
        The code above represents how we make the pancake 10 times. It starts from the first piece: <code class="code-text">piece = 1</code>. Then it checks if the number of the pancake we made is less than 10: <code class="code-text">piece <= 10</code>, and if it's true, it execute the pancaking frying process. Once its done, the piece count would be incremented by 1: <code class="code-text">piece++</code>. The loop continues until the condition <code class="code-text">piece <= 10</code> is not met.
        <br>
        <br>
        It can be seen that loops provide a convenient way to automate repetitive tasks by executing a block of code multiple times, saving you from writing the same code over and over again.
      </p>
        
     

      

      <h2>
        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
      </h2>

      <p>
        The DOM is a powerful tool that allows us to manipulate elements on our web page. With the DOM, we can target specific elements and dynamically change their content, structure, and styling.
        <br>
        <br>
        We often use the DOM when dealing with dynamic content. Take your favourite online shopping website as an example, when you add items to your cart, the cart number displayed in the top right corner usually updates automatically. It would be impossible for someone to manually type in the updated number every time you add an item. This is where the DOM comes to the rescue. It helps us target the cart number element and dynamically update it based on your cart items.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a user interacts with a website, various interactions, triggers, and effects occur. It would be impractical to set elements as static because their content depends on user behaviour. The DOM allows us to target HTML elements and modify them based on user actions. This way, the website can respond dynamically to user input, creating a seamless and interactive experience.   
      </p>

      <h2>
        Explain the difference between accessing data from <code class="code-text">arrays</code> and <code class="code-text">objects</code>.
      </h2>

      <p>
       <b>Array:</b>
       <br>
       <br>
      
        We use [ ] to represent array. [ ] looks like a box so let's imagine you have a box of fruits. The box is an array, and each fruit that placed one after the other inside the box represents an element in the array. 

        To get a fruit from this array box, you need to first count its position in the box. For example, the first fruit is at position 1, the second is at position 2, and so on. To get the fruit, you need to call its position to reach it. 
        <br>
       <br>
        Similarly, in my code, we access an element in an array by its numerical position, called the index. The first element is index 0, the second index 1, and so on. We call <code class="code-text">array[0]</code>, <code class="code-text">array[1]</code>...<code class="code-text">array[i]</code> to get the element. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <br>
          <b>Object:</b>
          <br>
          <br>
         
           We use { } to represent object. Imagine we have a apple in our hand. The apple is an object. It has properties such as a color, size, weight, price and so on. 
           
           Similarily, in JavaScript, the apple is the object, color, size are properties, and red, 150g is the value. Properties and its values determine the charastetics of an object. 
          
           <pre class="code-example">
            <code>
              const apple = {
                color: 'red',
                weight: '150g'
              }
          </code>
          </pre>

          <p>
           To get a certian property from an object, we use . or []. For example, to get weight of the apple, we can write <code class="code-text">apple.weight</code> or <code class="code-text">apple['weight']</code> to get the value of 150g. 
          </p>
           
      
           


           <h2>
            Explain what <code class="code-text">functions</code> are and why they are helpful.
           </h2>

           <p>
            Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript In JavaScript, functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks that you can reuse in multiple places in your program. When we write a program, we may need to use the same task multiple times, it would be very time consuming and our code would get very messy if we right the same task again and again in our code. Therefore to make it more organised and better readability, we use function to pack the steps of the task so that we only need to write the task once and reuse it by only inserting the function name. This would also contribute significantly in making the code maintenance easier. When we need to modify some part of the code of a task, you can make the change within the function instead of searching and modifying the same piece of code again and again in multiple places.
            <br>
            <br>
            Functions also helps to break down complex task into smaller steps. With each function carrying a single managible task, the code would be much easier to read and understand.
