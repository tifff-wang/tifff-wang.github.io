      <h2>Neuroplasticity:</h2>

      <h3>
        &#x2022; How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people?
      </h3>

      <p>
        The term “neuroplasticity”, or we can call it “brain plasticity” for
        easier understanding, stands for the ability of our brains to reorganise
        and develop, both physically and functionally, through the experience of
        interacting with the external environment. People used to believe that
        only children’s brains are plastic, as they grow older, the plasticity
        faded and no new changes can be made to it. However, current research
        shows that at any age, brains remain plastic and can be significantly
        improved through getting Repetitive and intense training that drives a
        specific brain function can lead to enhancement of that function, even
        an injured brain can be recovered through such training.
        <br />
        <br />
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity supports people to pay
        more attention to maintaining their brain health as they can actively
        engage in activities that promote cognitive well-being. It also
        motivates people to practice more when learning a new skill because they
        know that their ability to grasp new skills can be improved through
        practice and effort.
      </p>

      <h3>
        &#x2022; How I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my
        benefit?
      </h3>

      <p>
        After learning about the concept of neuroplasticity, I feel highly
        motivated, especially in the context of learning coding languages.
        Firstly, it reinforces my belief that my coding skills can improve with
        consistent effort and practice. This mindset empowers me to embrace
        challenges and persist in my coding journey. Secondly, it encourages me
        to actively engage with the material while learning to code. Instead of
        passively following tutorials or code examples, I tend to practice
        through hands-on coding exercises, writing my own code, and
        experimenting with various solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>
        &#x2022; What are some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity?
      </h3>

      <p>
        First of all, to practice, practice, practice! With consistent practice
        the coding concepts through a series of relevant exercises, I can
        strongly feel that I tend to think more like a programmer now.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, pushing the boundaries and embracing challenges is
        crucial. Once I feel comfortable writing simple functions to solve basic
        questions, I actively seek out more complex scenarios, such as tackling
        the stretch challenges provided in the courses. By introducing variety
        and intensity into my coding practice and tackling diverse problems, I
        train myself to think critically and explore multiple solutions for the
        same problem.

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

      <h3>&#x2022; Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>

      <p>
        A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve your abilities and
        intelligence through effort and learning. It's about seeing challenges
        as opportunities to grow and understanding that your talents can develop
        over time. The concept was introduced by psychologist Carol S. Dweck in
        her book "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success." People with a growth
        mindset embrace challenges, learn from failure, and are inspired by
        others' success. Having a growth mindset boosts motivation, resilience,
        and a love for learning. It also encourages seeking feedback and viewing
        setbacks as chances for improvement, leading to personal and
        professional development.
      </p>

      <h3>
        &#x2022; How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?
      </h3>

      <p>
        When I initially started learning to code, I used to hesitate when it
        came to modifying functions that were already working or changing the
        code structure provided by the course. It reflected my fixed mindset.
        However, as I delved deeper into different concepts and methods, I
        realised that even if a function is functioning correctly, there might
        be a better way to write it. For instance, in my recent practice, I
        updated a previous function I had written by employing a chained high
        order function, resulting in cleaner code that enhances readability.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, at the beginning of my coding journey, I often became
        frustrated when I encountered obstacles or made mistakes. However, after
        familiarising myself with the concept of a growth mindset, I began to
        embrace these mistakes and setbacks. Instead of viewing them as personal
        failures, I now recognize them as valuable learning opportunities. I
        understand that making errors is a natural part of the learning process
        and can provide insights for improvement.
