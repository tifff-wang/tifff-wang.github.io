      <h1>My reflections for the foundation core learning.</h1>

      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>

      <p>
        At the beginning of the course, I was initially reluctant to revisit my
        past due to the intense burnout from my previous career. However,
        through core learning, I mustered the courage to reflect deeply on my
        past experiences and identify the highlights of my capabilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another valuable insight I gained about myself is a better understanding
        of my brain. The discussions on neuroplasticity during the sprint
        provided me with great motivation to practice coding on a daily basis
        and embrace challenges and mistakes. With this theory as a foundation, I
        noticed that my self-esteem has also grown as I've noticed a shift
        towards thinking more like a programmer through repetitive practice.
        <br />
        <br />
        The third lesson I learned came from the exercises on listening and
        looping. Through these practices, I recognised my ability to be a good
        listener and show empathy. However, I also identified areas for
        improvement, particularly in expressing myself more effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>

      <p>
        I believe that in learning and programming, my values help me stay
        focused on my learning goals and prioritise what's important. When
        programming, my values of integrity encourage me to continuously improve
        the readability and maintainability of my code.
        <br />
        <br />
        Empathy enables me to put myself in the shoes of users, understanding
        their needs to create a more user-centric outcome. For example, after
        finishing the sprint tech project exercises, I always think about what
        features can be added to make the product more intuitive. Additionally,
        empathy also helps foster communication and collaboration by actively
        listening to others and considering diverse perspectives.
        <br />
        <br />
        Self-awareness helps me identify my strengths, weaknesses, and learning
        preferences. This awareness guides the tailoring of my programming
        learning plan, seeking resources that best support my learning style,
        and learning from mistakes to address areas that need improvement.
      </p>

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        What surprises me is that, initially, I thought my goal was solely to
        learn coding skills. However, as I followed the questions to formulate
        my learning plan, I realised that I have even higher expectations.
        Learning how to express my ideas confidently and collaborate effectively
        with others are also key skills I am eager to develop."
      </p>

      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

      <p>
        The most challenging aspect for me is probably the process of finding my
        values and identity. Looking back at my past, I made lots of mistakes in
        choosing my career path, which resulted in feeling totally lost and
        unsure of who I am. However, deep inside me, I know that I have the
        capability to achieve great things. Though it wasn't easy, by following
        the core reflection questions, I was able to discover who I am, what I
        believe in, and what my goals are.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>

      <p>
        I believe Dev Academy is providing us with a holistic education,
        enabling us to become programmers who can work both independently and
        collaboratively in teams. In our future careers, teamwork will be an
        essential aspect of project development, especially when companies adopt
        Agile methodologies. As programmers, we will not only communicate with
        fellow programmers but also with cross-functional teams such as
        designers, clients, and other stakeholders. Therefore, the core learning
        provides us with opportunities to learn effective communication skills,
        including the ability to articulate ideas, discuss technical concepts,
        and provide feedback, which are all crucial skills for being a good team
        player who contributes to enhancing the team culture.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead?
      </h2>

      <p>
        At the beginning of the course, I preferred tackling the tech challenges
        first, as I found answering the core questions much more challenging.
        After several sprints of core learning, I realised that this approach
        was beneficial for developing my self-esteem, strengthening my
        determination, and helping me identify my weaknesses that I should
        continue to focus on improving during the bootcamp.
