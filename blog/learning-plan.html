      <h2>
        What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h2>

      <p>
        My long-term goal is to establish a successful career as a software developer from junior to intermedia to senior level. I recognise that within this field, there are various career paths, such as front-end, back-end, web development, and mobile app development. I believe that after acquiring a fundamental knowledge and skills through my time at Dev Academy and starting my career in the tech industry, I will gradually figuring out which career path aligns most with my interests and strengths. This exploration will enable me to make an informed decision on which specific path or set of programming languages I would like to specialise in and further deepen my expertise.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
      </h2>

      <p>
        My strengths when it comes to learning is my capacity to visualise abstract concepts. This strength allows me to understand coding languages in a more efficient way. Another strenth of mine lies in my strong research skills. I'm good at asking targeted questions that guides me to find the solution in an effective way. 
        <br>
        <br>
        However, I do encounter a limitation in terms of time management during my learning. Possibly due to my web design background, I often find myself delving into a "rabbit hole," spending excessive time refining styling, adding features, and practicing coding for extended periods. I end up feeling exhausted and being detracted from my original learning plan. To address this limitation, I am currently actively working on improving my time management skills by using the recommended tool, Toggle to ensure that I maintain a balance between exploration and efficiency.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>

      <p>
        While at Dev Academy, I would like to see myself actively participate in peer coding and group projects which I’ve never tried before, honing my teamwork and collaboration skills. Additionally, I am also looking to enhance my communication skills, which would allow me to confidently convey technical concepts to both tech-savvy and non-technical individuals.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
      </h2>

      <p>
        To effectively manage my workload in this program, I will:
        <ol>
          <li>Make a learning plan at the beginning of each week and trying best to stick to the plan. </li>
          <li>Allocate sufficient rest time to refresh my mind. </li>
          <li>Prepare questions before group meetings.. </li>
          <li>Prioritise my to-do-list when I feel things are building up.</li>
          <li>Seek help from facilitators sooner rather than later when tasks start to pile up.</li>
        </ol> 
      </p>

      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h2>

      <p>
        I will first attempt to solve the problem independently. I will set a reasonable timeframe for myself to troubleshoot the issue.
        <br>
        <br>
        If I cannot find a solution through self-troubleshooting, I will Google and check the Discord #tech-questions channel to see if there are similar problems and solutions.
        <br>
        <br>
        If the problem still persists, I will reach out to my peer group and facilitator for assistance.    
      </p>

      <h2>
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Knowing that the facilitation team is there to support me when I have questions assures me that I always have a backup if I stuck. This actually gives me the confidence to set a time-frame to try to solve problems by myself first. I also expect the facilitation team to teach us what’s the best industry practice and provide suggestions on better coding practices and solutions for my projects.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
      </h2>

      <p>
        I have a 2-year-old boy who goes to daycare. I may have block-out times if my boy falls sick and needs mummy to be around.
