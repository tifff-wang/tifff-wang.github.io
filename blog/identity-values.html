      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>

      <p>
        I encountered an ethical decision while working as a team leader in a
        childcare center. One of my team members consistently made grammar
        errors in her learning stories shared with parents, even after they were
        proofread. My manager emphasised that as a team leader, it was my
        responsibility to address the issue and prevent the teacher from
        repeating the same mistakes. However, the teacher is my good friend, who
        had a sensitive personality. After a thorough consideration, I decided
        to discuss the issue with her and provide constructive feedback, even
        though it led to her becoming very upset with tears. Later that evening,
        I wrote a long letter to her, explaining my decision and emphasising
        that it was driven by our collective goal of delivering high-quality
        learning records for the benefit of the children.
        <br />
        <br />
        I feel that this ethical decision was an experience of balancing between
        leading the team towards professional excellence and managing personal
        relationships with team members. Previously, I was a very soft person
        who never dare to point out other people’s mistake or speak up when I
        have different opinion. However, as I gained valuable working experience
        with professionals and being more mature, I became more committed to the
        goals and developed the courage to communicate my concerns and providing
        constructive feedbacks.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Prior to my arrival in New Zealand, I was raised in an environment where
        strict adherence to rules and procedures were emphasised from my early
        school years. However, my experiences in New Zealand have taught me the
        value of being open-minded and thinking critically from various aspects.
        In this culture, individuals are encouraged to share their opinions and
        actively identify gaps or areas for improvement in established
        procedures. Additionally, the concept of teamwork in New Zealand has had
        a great impact on me. Previously, I held the belief that individual
        capabilities determine the success. However,through my work experience
        in NZ, I have had numerous opportunities to engage in teamwork and
        collaboration, which has highlighted the importance of being a good team
        player and the positive impact it can have on achieving efficient
        outcomes.

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>

      <p>
        One of my strengths that greatly supports me during my learning journey
        is my strong commitment and motivation towards my career change. After
        going through a period of feeling lost and uncertain about my direction,
        I eventually discovered a clear purpose and goal to strive for. This has
        fuelled a strong determination within me. Whenever I faced with
        challenges, my strong commitment would push me forward to overcome
        difficulties and strengthen my dedication to learning and growth.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>

      <p>
        I’m a artsy person which can be beneficial in design fields but I find
        it hinder my time management on coding practices. I tend to focus more
        and more on refining layouts and styles, which results in neglecting the
        initial goal of building a minimum viable product. This can lead to
        delays and challenges in meeting deadlines.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another limitation is my hesitancy to engage in networking with people
        who work in the tech industry. Coming from an educational background,
        most of my connections are ECE teachers. I understand that networking is
        important in career development, especially landing the first job. But I
        still don’t have the courage to connect with professionals possibly due
        to lack of confidence in my technical skills.

      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Based on my previous experience with teamwork, I have noticed that
        resistance and tension often arise when goals and rules are unclear, and
        when open communication is lacking. To address these challenges, I found
        that establishing clear goals and plans is crucial. Having a
        well-defined goal helps prevent misunderstandings among team members.
        Also using task management tools such as Trello boards can be an
        effective strategy to ensure that all team members are aware of the plan
        and each other's progress.
        <br />
        <br />
        When tension happens, an open communication is essential. I usually like
        to create a safe space where team members can express their concerns,
        opinions, and ideas without fear of judgment. It helps us to find the
        root causes of tension. However, sometimes when the tension or conflict
        is too intense where personal emotions come into play, I feel that a
        proper calm break is neccesary rather than forcing the communication. I
        found it also works more effectively when invite a neutral person such
        as a facilitator to join the meeting to guide the team to solve the
        conflict.
