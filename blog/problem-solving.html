        I have reached week 4 of my coding journey, and along the way, I have
        gained valuable insights into problem-solving. I would like to share
        some of my experiences in problem-solving with my non-tech friend.
      </p>
      <h2>When there was a time I was blocked on a simple problem.</h2>

      <p>
        The most recent simple problem I encountered was when I attempted to
        create a function to capitalise each word in a sentence. I quickly wrote
        down the steps and felt confident in my logic. However, when I tested my
        code, it failed. I reviewed the code I had written but couldn't identify
        any issues. I felt stuck and decided to apply the rubber ducky method by
        speaking the requirement and my solution steps out loud, even though I
        used my cat instead of a rubber duck!
        <br />
        <br />
        During the process of explaining the problem step by step, I suddenly
        realised that I had applied my function to the wrong target. I had
        assumed that I was given a box of words (we call it an array of words)
        and needed to capitalize each one. However, what I actually received was
        a complete sentence (we call it a string). Therefore, I needed to first
        separate the words and place each word in a box before capitalising them
        individually, and then assemble all the capitalised words back into a
        sentence.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once I added the missing step, the test passed successfully. I found the
        rubber ducky method, or rather my "cutie cat" method, to be incredibly
        useful. Sometimes, even when a problem appears simple, it's easy for us
        to overlook essential details. The act of explaining the problem step by
        step, whether to a rubber duck or a cat, helps us identify and address
        those missing pieces.

      <h2>When there was a time I elegantly solved a problem.</h2>

      <p>
        I would like to share another experience where I elegantly solved a
        problem. I was working on building a cafe order page and adding some new
        features from the challenge exercises provided in the course. There were
        a total of 8 questions, and when I reached the 4th question, I stuck. I
        discovered conflicts between the features, where individual functions
        designed for specific features would work independently but fail when
        multiple features were combined.
        <br />
        <br />
        For instance, I had implemented a feature to display ingredients in red
        text when they were running out of stock. However, as I added more
        features, sometimes the stock text would turn red even though there were
        still 2 items left in stock. To identify the root cause of the problem,
        I utilised a tool called “console.log” to display the output of my code
        line-by-line, helping me to identify the exact part that was causing the
        issue.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through this exploration, I found that the logic I had used for the
        first 3 questions was not ideal when more features will come into play.
        Therefore, Instead of addressing the questions one by one, I tried to
        read through all 8 questions to gain a comprehensive understanding of
        the required features and their relationships. Then, I wrote down the
        steps to create a rough structure of my code and rewrite the code
        accordingly. I discovered that the coding process became much smoother
        when I had a clear picture in my mind of the entire project.
        <br />
        <br />
        This experience taught me the importance of having a holistic view and a
        draft plan of how the different functions and features will work
        together when dealing with multiple questions related to the same
        project.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Reflect on how confident I feel using each of the following
        problem-solving techniques/processes:
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode</li>
        <li>Trying something</li>
        <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
        <li>Console.logging</li>
        <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
        <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The problem-solving methods I use vary depending on the cases. Based on
        my coding experience, I found that console.logging, reading error
        messages, trying something, and googling are effective for most of the
        problems that I encountered. I have also found pseudocode to be a
        valuable tool that I recently learned. It allows me to plan ahead and
        outline the logical steps necessary to solve a problem before diving
        into the actual coding process. I often use the rubber duck method (my
        cat) to catch any missed details. If the problem persists, I seek help
        from peers or coaches. After solving a problem, I usually like to
        reflect and note down what I’ve learned in a text file for future
        reference.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflect on a time I was reluctant to ask for help.</h2>

      <p>
        I have been able to solve the majority of problems through
        troubleshooting. This means when I am stuck on something, the problem is
        complex. However, when I encounter those complex issues that are
        difficult to explain concisely within just short descriptions and
        screenshots, I feel reluctant to ask for help due to the complexity of
        describing the problem. But think about the reality that such situation
        would happen a lot when I work in a company with complex projects.
        Therefore, when similar complex challenges occur again in the future, I
        would like to try booking a video call meeting with a coach, allowing us
        to discuss the problem more effectively by sharing screens.
